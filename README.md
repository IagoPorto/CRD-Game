# 🎮🧠 CDR-Game

**CDR-Game** is an experimental project that integrates artificial intelligence agents within a gaming environment. The game features two distinct AI agents: one utilizing **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and the other employing a **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** network. The project is implemented in Java and serves as a platform to explore and compare different AI methodologies in game scenarios.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dual AI Agents**: Implements two AI strategies:
  - **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Learns optimal actions through trial and error interactions with the game environment.
  - **Self-Organizing Map Agent**: Utilizes unsupervised learning to map input patterns and make decisions based on the trained network.
- **Game Environment**: A customizable game setting designed to test and compare the performance of different AI agents.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tools to evaluate and visualize the effectiveness and learning progress of each AI agent.
